# File Upload System Revision Summary

## Overview

Complete revision of the file uploading system to ensure proper handling of different file types with no misreading.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend Dependencies (`requirements.txt`)

**Added Libraries:**

- `olefile>=0.46` - For legacy .doc file format support
- `python-docx2txt>=0.8` - Text extraction from Word documents
- `python-magic>=0.4.27` - File type detection by magic bytes
- `python-magic-bin>=0.4.14` - Windows binary for python-magic

**Purpose:** Enables robust reading of legacy .doc files and accurate file type detection.

---

### 2. File Processing Service (`backend/app/services/file_processing_service.py`)

#### Imports Added

```python
from fastapi import HTTPException
import olefile  # For legacy .doc file format support
import docx2txt  # For text extraction from Word documents
```

#### Key Improvements

**A. Legacy .doc File Processing (`_process_doc` method)**

- Completely rewritten to handle legacy Microsoft Word .doc files
- Multi-layered approach:
  1. Uses `olefile` to check if file is valid OLE format
  2. Attempts extraction with `docx2txt`
  3. Falls back to binary extraction from WordDocument stream
  4. Handles misnamed .docx files with .doc extension
  5. Last resort: plain text reading with error handling
- Detects fillable blanks (underscores, placeholders, markers)
- Provides helpful error messages if reading fails

**B. Enhanced .xlsx File Processing (`_process_xlsx` method)**

- Loads workbook twice: once with `data_only=False` (formulas) and once with `data_only=True` (calculated values)
- Preserves both formulas and their calculated values
- Extracts formula information including:
  - Cell reference
  - Formula text
  - Calculated value
- Returns structured data with `formulas` and `has_formulas` fields
- Better error handling with full traceback logging

**C. Improved .xls File Processing (`_process_xls` method)**

- Uses pandas with xlrd engine for legacy Excel files
- Converts DataFrame to list of lists for consistency
- Includes note about formula evaluation (formulas are calculated to values in .xls)
- Fallback to openpyxl engine if xlrd fails
- Helpful error message recommending .xlsx for better compatibility

---

### 3. File Service (`backend/app/services/file_service.py`)

#### Imports Added

```python
import magic  # python-magic for file type detection
```

#### Key Improvements

**A. File Type Validation by Content (`_validate_file_type_by_content` method)**

- Validates files using magic bytes/file signatures
- Returns `(is_valid, detected_mime_type)` tuple
- Special handling for Office documents:
  - **DOCX:** Accepts `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document` or `application/zip`
  - **DOC:** Accepts `application/msword` or `application/x-ole-storage`
  - **XLSX:** Accepts `application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet` or `application/zip`
  - **XLS:** Accepts `application/vnd.ms-excel` or `application/x-ole-storage`
- **CSV Validation:** Ensures CSV files are not misnamed Excel files
- Logs detailed information for debugging

**B. Magic Byte Detection (`_detect_mime_by_signature` method)**
Fallback method that checks common file signatures:

- PDF: `%PDF`
- ZIP (docx, xlsx): `PK\x03\x04`
- OLE format (doc, xls): `\xD0\xCF\x11\xE0\xA1\xB1\x1A\xE1`
- PNG: `\x89PNG\r\n\x1a\n`
- JPEG: `\xFF\xD8\xFF`
- GIF: `GIF87a` or `GIF89a`

**C. Enhanced save_file Method**

- Uses content-based validation instead of just filename extension
- Provides specific error messages:
  - If CSV is actually Excel: "File appears to be an Excel file, but has .csv extension. Please save as .xlsx or .xls format."
  - If Word doc is invalid: "File does not appear to be a valid Word document. Detected type: {detected_mime}"
  - If Excel file is invalid: "File does not appear to be a valid Excel file. Detected type: {detected_mime}"
- Removed automatic extension correction to prevent confusion

---

### 4. Workshop API (`backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/workshop.py`)

#### Enhanced extract_file_content Function

**A. Word Document Processing**

- Added support for `application/x-ole-storage` content type (legacy .doc files)
- Detects file extension (.doc vs .docx)
- For .docx: Uses python-docx with table extraction
- For .doc: Uses FileProcessingService.\_process_doc method
- Fallback mechanism for ambiguous cases

**B. Excel File Processing**

- Clear separation between CSV and Excel files
- Logs file extension for debugging
- For .xlsx: Preserves formulas and formatting
- For .xls: Handles legacy format with appropriate engine
- Formats output to include:
  - Formula information (cell, formula, calculated value)
  - Sheet names (for multi-sheet workbooks)
  - Properly formatted data rows
- Better error handling with detailed logging

---

### 5. Frontend Changes

#### A. File Processing Panel (`frontend/src/components/workshop/FileProcessingPanel.tsx`)

Updated `useDropzone` accept parameter to include:

- **Word Documents:** `.doc`, `.docx`
- **Excel Files:** `.xls`, `.xlsx`
- **Other formats:** PDF, TXT, RTF, CSV, JSON, XML, Code files, Images
- Added helpful comments distinguishing Excel from CSV

#### B. File Processing Service (`frontend/src/services/fileProcessingService.ts`)

**Enhanced validateFile Method:**

- Comprehensive file extension validation
- Defines allowed extensions with descriptive names:
  - Word Documents: `.doc` (Legacy), `.docx`
  - Excel Spreadsheets: `.xls` (Legacy), `.xlsx`
  - Note for CSV: "CSV File (Note: For Excel files, use .xlsx)"
- Helpful error messages:
  ```
  File type '${extension}' is not supported. Please upload:
  • Word Documents (.doc, .docx)
  • Excel Spreadsheets (.xls, .xlsx)
  • PDFs, Text files, Code files, or Images
  ```
- Special validation for Excel vs CSV mismatches

4. Add support for more image formats
5. Consider adding support for OpenDocument formats (.odt, .ods)

---

## Support

If users encounter issues with specific file formats:

1. Check logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify file is not corrupted
3. Try converting to modern format (.docx, .xlsx)
4. For .doc files, recommend saving as .docx
5. For .xls files, recommend saving as .xlsx for formula preservation
