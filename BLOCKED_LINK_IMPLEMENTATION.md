# Blocked Link Implementation - Clean User Experience

## 🎯 What We've Changed

Instead of showing extracted text when iframes are blocked, we now show a **clean, informative message** that explains why the preview isn't available and provides clear options for the user.

## 🆕 New User Experience

### For Blocked Sites (like Fandom/Terraria Wiki):

```
User submits URL → Detects blocking → Shows blocked message → User can open in new tab or chat with AI
```

User submits URL → Shows web preview → User can view content and chat with AI
```
