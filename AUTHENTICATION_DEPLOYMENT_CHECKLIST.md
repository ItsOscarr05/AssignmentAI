  - [ ] Error handling and user feedback

- [ ] **Routing**: All routes are properly configured
  - [ ] `/login` - Login page
  - [ ] `/register` - Registration page
  - [ ] `/forgot-password` - Forgot password page
  - [ ] `/reset-password` - Reset password page
  - [ ] Protected routes redirect to login when not authenticated

### ✅ Environment Configuration

- [ ] **Development Environment**:

  - [ ] `VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000` in `.env`
  - [ ] Backend running on port 8000
  - [ ] Database connection configured

- [ ] **Production Environment**:
  - [ ] `VITE_API_URL=https://api.assignmentai.app` in `.env.production`
  - [ ] SSL certificates configured
  - [ ] Domain and DNS configured
  - [ ] CDN configured (if applicable)

### ✅ Testing

- [ ] **Manual Testing**:

  - [ ] User registration flow
  - [ ] User login flow
  - [ ] Password reset flow
  - [ ] Logout functionality
  - [ ] Session management
  - [ ] Error handling

- [ ] **Automated Testing**:
  - [ ] Run authentication test script: `node scripts/test-auth.js`
  - [ ] All tests pass
  - [ ] Frontend unit tests pass
  - [ ] Backend unit tests pass

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Backend Deployment

```bash
# 1. Set up production environment
cp backend/.env.example backend/.env.production
# Edit backend/.env.production with production values

# 2. Install dependencies
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Run database migrations
alembic upgrade head

# 4. Start the backend server
uvicorn app.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### 2. Frontend Deployment

```bash
# 1. Set up production environment
cp frontend/env.production.template frontend/.env.production
# Edit frontend/.env.production with production values

# 2. Install dependencies
cd frontend
npm install

# 3. Build for production
npm run build

# 4. Deploy to your hosting platform
# (Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3, etc.)
```

### 3. Post-Deployment Verification

```bash
# 1. Test the authentication system
node scripts/test-auth.js

# 2. Verify all endpoints are accessible
curl https://api.assignmentai.app/api/v1/health

# 3. Test the frontend
# Open https://assignmentai.app and test:
# - Registration
# - Login
# - Password reset
# - Logout
```

## Production Considerations

### Security

- [ ] **HTTPS**: All traffic uses HTTPS
- [ ] **CORS**: CORS is properly configured for production domains
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Rate limiting is enabled and configured
- [ ] **Secrets**: All secrets are stored in environment variables
- [ ] **Logging**: Security events are logged
- [ ] **Monitoring**: Authentication failures are monitored

### Performance

- [ ] **Caching**: API responses are cached where appropriate
- [ ] **CDN**: Static assets are served via CDN
- [ ] **Database**: Database is optimized for authentication queries
- [ ] **Load Balancing**: Load balancer is configured (if applicable)

### Monitoring

- [ ] **Health Checks**: Health check endpoints are monitored
- [ ] **Error Tracking**: Error tracking is configured (Sentry, etc.)
- [ ] **Analytics**: User authentication analytics are tracked
- [ ] **Alerts**: Authentication failures trigger alerts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CORS Errors**: Ensure CORS is configured for production domains
2. **Token Issues**: Check JWT secret and token expiration settings
3. **Email Not Sending**: Verify email service configuration
4. **Database Connection**: Check database connection string and credentials
5. **Rate Limiting**: Adjust rate limiting settings if needed

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check backend logs
tail -f backend/logs/app.log

# Check frontend build
npm run build --verbose

# Test API endpoints
curl -X POST https://api.assignmentai.app/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"test@example.com","password":"password"}'

# Check environment variables
echo $VITE_API_URL
```

## Rollback Plan

If issues are discovered after deployment:

1. **Immediate Rollback**: Revert to previous deployment
2. **Database Rollback**: Restore database from backup if needed
3. **Configuration Rollback**: Revert environment variable changes
4. **Investigation**: Debug issues in staging environment
5. **Re-deployment**: Deploy fixes after testing

## Success Criteria

The authentication system is ready for production when:

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Manual testing confirms all flows work
- [ ] Security measures are in place
- [ ] Monitoring is configured
- [ ] Documentation is updated
- [ ] Team is trained on the system
