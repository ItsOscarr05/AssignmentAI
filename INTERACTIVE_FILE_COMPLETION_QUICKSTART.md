   ```
   Title: The Impact of Technology

   Introduction: ___________

   Body Paragraph 1:
   Technology has changed ________

   Body Paragraph 2:
   The future of technology _______

   Conclusion: ___________
   ```

2. Upload it to Workshop

3. Click "Interactive"

4. Type: "Fill in all blank sections with detailed content"

5. Watch the AI:
   - Respond in chat
   - Show proposed content in preview
   - Wait for you to click "Apply Changes"
