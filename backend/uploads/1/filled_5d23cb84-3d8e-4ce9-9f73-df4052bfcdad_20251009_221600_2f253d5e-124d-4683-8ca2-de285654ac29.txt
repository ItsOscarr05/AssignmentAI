Physics I – Kinematics Quiz
Q1) A car accelerates from rest at 2 m/s^2 for 5 s. What is its final velocity?
Q2) Drop a ball from 20 m (no air resistance). Approximate time to hit the ground?
Q3) 60–80 words: Explain difference between velocity and speed with an example.

The final velocity of the car can be calculated using the formula: 

\[ v = u + at \]

where:
- \( v \) = final velocity
- \( u \) = initial velocity (0 m/s, since the car starts from rest)
- \( a \) = acceleration (2 m/s²)
- \( t \) = time (5 s)

Substituting the values:

\[ v = 0 + (2 \, \text{m/s}²)(5 \, \text{s}) = 10 \, \text{m/s} \]

Thus, the final velocity of the car is 10 m/s.
To approximate the time it takes for a ball to hit the ground when dropped from a height of 20 meters, we can use the kinematic equation for free fall, which is:

\[ d = \frac{1}{2} g t^2 \]

Where:
- \( d \) is the distance fallen (20 m),
- \( g \) is the acceleration due to gravity (approximately \( 9.81 \, m/s^2 \)),
- \( t \) is the time in seconds.

Rearranging the equation to solve for time \( t \):

\[ t = \sqrt{\frac{2d}{g}} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ t = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 20 \, m}{9.81 \, m/s^2}} \]

Calculating the result:

\[ t \approx \sqrt{\frac{40}{9.81}} \approx \sqrt{4.08} \approx 2.02 \, s \]

Therefore, the approximate time for the ball to hit the ground is about 2.02 seconds.
Velocity is a vector quantity that refers to the rate of change of an object's position in a specific direction, while speed is a scalar quantity that measures how fast an object is moving regardless of direction. For example, a car traveling at 60 km/h eastward has a velocity of 60 km/h east, whereas its speed is simply 60 km/h. Thus, velocity includes direction, whereas speed does not.
