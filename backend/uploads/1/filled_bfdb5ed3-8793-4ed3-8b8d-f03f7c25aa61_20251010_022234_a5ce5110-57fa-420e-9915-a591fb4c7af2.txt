### Geography – Short Answer

Q1) Name two factors that influence climate in coastal regions.  
A1) Two factors that influence climate in coastal regions are ocean currents and prevailing winds. Ocean currents can affect water temperatures, while prevailing winds can influence the distribution of moisture and temperature in coastal areas.

Q2) 30–50 words: Explain why mountain ranges affect rainfall patterns.  
A2) Mountain ranges affect rainfall patterns through orographic lifting, where moist air is forced to rise over the mountains, cooling and condensing to form precipitation on the windward side. Conversely, the leeward side often experiences drier conditions, creating a rain shadow effect.
