Q1) A car accelerates from rest at 2 m/s^2 for 5 s. What is its final velocity?: To find the final velocity of the car, we start with the fact that the car is accelerating from rest. This means its initial velocity is 0 m/s. 

Now, the car accelerates at a rate of 2 meters per second squared (m/s²) for 5 seconds. To find the final velocity, we can use a simple formula: 

Final Velocity = Initial Velocity + (Acceleration × Time)

Since the initial velocity is 0 m/s, we can plug that into our formula. So it looks like this:

Final Velocity = 0 m/s + (2 m/s² × 5 s)

Now, we need to do the multiplication. First, we multiply the acceleration (2 m/s²) by the time (5 s):

2 m/s² × 5 s = 10 m/s

Now we can go back to our formula for final velocity:

Final Velocity = 0 m/s + 10 m/s

This means that the final velocity is simply 10 m/s.

To summarize, after 5 seconds of accelerating from rest at 2 m/s², the car reaches a final velocity of 10 meters per second. 

So, the final answer is 10 m/s. 

Just to mention, we assumed that the car is moving in a straight line and there are no other forces acting on it, like friction or air resistance, that would affect the acceleration.
Q2) Drop a ball from 20 m (no air resistance). Approximate time to hit the ground?: Let's solve the problem of how long it takes for a ball to hit the ground when dropped from a height of 20 meters, assuming there’s no air resistance.

First, we need to understand that when we drop a ball, it falls due to the force of gravity. In this case, the height we are dropping from is 20 meters.

Now, there’s a formula we can use to find out the time it takes for the ball to hit the ground. The formula for the time of a free-falling object is:

time = square root of (2 × height ÷ gravity)

In our case, the height is 20 meters, and the acceleration due to gravity is approximately 9.8 meters per second squared (m/s²). 

Let's plug in the numbers:

1. We multiply 2 by the height of 20 meters: 
   2 × 20 = 40.

2. Now, we divide that by the gravity: 
   40 ÷ 9.8 = about 4.08.

3. Next, we take the square root of 4.08. To do this, we can estimate that the square root of 4 is 2, and the square root of 5 is a little more than 2, so the square root of 4.08 will be a bit more than 2.

When we calculate it, we find that the square root of 4.08 is about 2.02 seconds.

So, we can say that it takes about 2.0 seconds for the ball to hit the ground. 

Just to recap, we dropped the ball from 20 meters, used the formula for free fall, and found that the time to hit the ground is about 2.0 seconds.
Q3) 60–80 words: Explain difference between velocity and speed with an example.: Velocity and speed are both ways to describe how fast something moves, but they are not the same. Speed is how fast an object travels, regardless of direction. For example, if a car is going 60 kilometers per hour, that’s its speed. On the other hand, velocity tells us both the speed and the direction. So if the car is going 60 kilometers per hour to the north, that’s its velocity. In short, speed is just a number, while velocity includes direction!
