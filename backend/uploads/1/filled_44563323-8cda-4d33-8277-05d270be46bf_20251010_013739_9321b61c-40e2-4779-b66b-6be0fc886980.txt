**Solution Format Example:**

1. Formula:  
   \( t = \sqrt{\frac{2h}{g}} \)  
   
2. Substitution:  
   \( t = \sqrt{\frac{2 \times 20 \, \text{m}}{9.8 \, \text{m/s}^2}} \)  
   
3. Calculation:  
   \( t = \sqrt{\frac{40}{9.8}} \approx \sqrt{4.08} \approx 2.02 \, \text{s} \)  
   
4. Final Answer:  
   \( t \approx 2.0 \, \text{s} \) (assuming from rest, no air resistance)
Q3) 60–80 words: Explain difference between velocity and speed with an example.: Velocity is a vector quantity that includes both speed and direction, while speed is a scalar quantity that only measures how fast an object moves regardless of direction. For example, if a car travels 60 km/h north, its speed is 60 km/h, but its velocity is 60 km/h north. This distinction is crucial in physics, as velocity provides information about the object's direction of motion, which is not conveyed by speed alone.
