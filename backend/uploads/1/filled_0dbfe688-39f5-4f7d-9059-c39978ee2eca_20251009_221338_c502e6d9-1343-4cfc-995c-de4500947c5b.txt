Two enabling factors of the Industrial Revolution in Britain were the availability of natural resources and advancements in technology. The abundance of coal and iron ore facilitated energy production and machinery construction, while innovations such as the steam engine revolutionized transportation and manufacturing processes, leading to increased efficiency and productivity.
- Urbanization: Rapid migration of populations from rural areas to cities led to overcrowding, often resulting in inadequate housing and sanitation. For example, cities like Manchester saw significant growth, leading to cramped living conditions for factory workers.

- Changes in Labor Conditions: The rise of factories created harsh working environments, with long hours, low wages, and unsafe conditions. Child labor was prevalent, with many children working in hazardous conditions for minimal pay.

- Social Stratification: Industrialization contributed to a distinct class system, widening the gap between the wealthy industrialists and the working class. This shift led to social tensions and the emergence of labor movements advocating for workers' rights.
Steam power was transformative for logistics because it significantly enhanced transportation speed and efficiency. The advent of steam engines enabled railways and steamships to move goods over long distances quickly and reliably, reducing transit times from weeks to days. For example, the introduction of steam locomotives in the 19th century facilitated the rapid movement of raw materials and finished products, thereby boosting trade and industrial growth. This technological advancement also allowed for the establishment of consistent schedules, improving supply chain reliability.
