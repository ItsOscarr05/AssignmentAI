Q1) A car accelerates from rest at 2 m/s^2 for 5 s. What is its final velocity?: Using v = at: 2 × 5 = 10 m/s
Q2) Drop a ball from 20 m (no air resistance). Approximate time to hit the ground?: Using t = √(2h/g): √(2 × 20 ÷ 9.8) = 2.0 s
Q3) 60–80 words: Explain difference between velocity and speed with an example.: Velocity is a vector quantity that includes both speed and direction, while speed is a scalar quantity that only measures how fast an object is moving without regard to direction. For example, if a car travels 60 km/h north, its speed is 60 km/h, but its velocity is 60 km/h north. This distinction is crucial in physics, as direction can significantly affect an object's motion.
