Q1) Name two factors that influence climate in coastal regions.  
A1) Two factors that influence climate in coastal regions are proximity to the ocean, which moderates temperatures, and prevailing winds, which can bring moisture and affect precipitation patterns.

Q2) 30–50 words: Explain why mountain ranges affect rainfall patterns.  
A2) Mountain ranges affect rainfall patterns through orographic lift. When moist air encounters a mountain, it rises, cools, and condenses, leading to precipitation on the windward side. The leeward side, in contrast, often experiences drier conditions, known as rain shadow effect.
