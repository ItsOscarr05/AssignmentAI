Q3) 60–80 words: Explain difference between velocity and speed with an example.: Velocity and speed both measure how fast an object is moving, but they differ in directionality. Speed is a scalar quantity that represents how fast an object travels without considering its direction, while velocity is a vector quantity that includes both speed and direction. For example, a car traveling at 60 km/h is described by its speed, whereas if it is moving north at 60 km/h, that specifies its velocity. Thus, velocity indicates both how fast and in which direction the object is moving.
