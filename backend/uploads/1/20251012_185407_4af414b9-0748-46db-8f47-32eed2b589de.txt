Geography – Short Answer

Q1) Name two factors that influence climate in coastal regions.
A1) Two significant factors that influence climate in coastal regions are the proximity to large bodies of water and ocean currents. The water bodies moderate the regional temperatures, making them more stable year-round, while ocean currents can either cool or warm the coastal climate depending on their temperature.

Q2) 30–50 words: Explain why mountain ranges affect rainfall patterns.
A2) Mountain ranges influence rainfall through orographic lift, where moist air rises and cools as it passes over mountains, leading to condensation and precipitation. This process typically creates wet conditions on the windward side of a mountain and dry conditions on the leeward side.
