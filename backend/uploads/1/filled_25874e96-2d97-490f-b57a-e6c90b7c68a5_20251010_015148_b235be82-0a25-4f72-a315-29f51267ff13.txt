Q1) A car accelerates from rest at 2 m/s^2 for 5 s. What is its final velocity?

Answer: Using v = at: 2 × 5 = 10 m/s
Q2) Drop a ball from 20 m (no air resistance). Approximate time to hit the ground?

Answer: Using t = sqrt(2h/g):  
t = sqrt(2 × 20 ÷ 9.8) = sqrt(4.08) ≈ 2.02 s  

Final answer: 2.02 s
Q3) 60–80 words: Explain difference between velocity and speed with an example.

Answer: Velocity is a vector quantity that includes both speed and direction, while speed is a scalar quantity that measures how fast an object moves without considering direction. For example, if a car travels 60 kilometers per hour east, its speed is 60 km/h, but its velocity is 60 km/h east. This difference is crucial in understanding motion, as velocity can indicate changes in direction, whereas speed does not.
