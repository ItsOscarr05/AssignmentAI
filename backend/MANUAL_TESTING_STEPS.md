# Manual Testing Steps for File Completion System

## üöÄ Quick Start Testing

### Option 1: Automated Backend Testing (Recommended)

1. **Run the comprehensive test script:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   py test_manual_file_completion.py
   ```
   
2. **Choose option 1 or 3** to run automated tests
3. **Check the results** - it will create test documents and show you the results

### Option 2: API Testing

1. **Start the backend server:**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   py -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

2. **Run the API test script:**
   ```bash
   py test_api_endpoints.py
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts** to test the API endpoints

### Option 3: Frontend Testing

1. **Start both servers:**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   cd backend
   py -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload

   # Terminal 2 - Frontend  
   cd frontend
   pnpm dev
   ```

2. **Open your browser:**
   - Go to http://localhost:5173
   - Log in with your credentials
   - Navigate to file upload/completion features
   - Upload a test document

## üìÑ Creating Test Documents

### For DOCX Testing:
Create a Word document with:
- A title/heading
- Some regular text
- A table with empty cells marked with `_____` or `[INSERT ANSWER HERE]`
- Empty paragraphs

### For Text Testing:
Create a .txt file with:
```

## üîç What to Look For

### ‚úÖ Success Indicators:
- File uploads without errors
- Processing completes successfully
- Completed file is created with "filled_" prefix
- Completed file opens in Word without corruption
- Content is properly filled in empty sections
- Original structure is preserved

### ‚ùå Failure Indicators:
- Word shows "unreadable content" error
- Multiple "filled_" prefixes in filename
- Empty or corrupted output files
- Missing content in completed sections

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### If files are still corrupted:
1. Check the logs in the terminal running the backend
2. Verify the file format is supported
3. Try with a simpler test document
4. Check if the file is already processed (look for existing "filled_" files)

### If API tests fail:
1. Make sure the backend server is running
2. Check your login credentials
3. Verify the file path is correct
4. Check the server logs for error messages

## üìä Expected Results

After successful testing, you should see:
- Clean, professional-looking completed documents
- No corruption errors when opening in Word
- Proper content filling in empty sections
- Maintained document structure and formatting
- Single "filled_" prefix in filenames
