# Test Coverage Improvement Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the systematic approach to achieve 100% test coverage for the AssignmentAI backend project.

## Current Status

- **Total Coverage: 65.94%**
- **Target: 80%+ (with 100% on critical files)**
- **Files needing improvement: 89 files**

## Priority Strategy

### Phase 1: Critical Files (<50% coverage) - 15 files

These files have the lowest coverage and represent the highest risk:

1. **app/services/database_service.py** (0% coverage)

   - **Strategy**: Create comprehensive service tests
   - **Test file**: `tests/test_database_service.py`

2. **app/services/file_completion.py** (0% coverage)

   - **Strategy**: Create comprehensive service tests
   - **Test file**: `tests/test_file_completion.py`

3. **app/api/v1/endpoints/dashboard.py** (20% coverage)

   - **Strategy**: Add missing endpoint tests to existing test file
   - **Test file**: `tests/api/v1/test_dashboard.py`

4. **app/services/backup_service.py** (20% coverage)

   - **Strategy**: Add missing service tests to existing test file
   - **Test file**: `tests/test_backup_service.py`

5. **app/services/citation_service.py** (12% coverage)

   - **Strategy**: Create comprehensive service tests
   - **Test file**: `tests/test_citation_service.py`

6. **app/services/payment_service.py** (19% coverage)

   - **Strategy**: Create comprehensive service tests
   - **Test file**: `tests/test_payment_service.py`

7. **app/services/cache_service.py** (25% coverage)

   - **Strategy**: Add missing service tests to existing test file
   - **Test file**: `tests/test_cache_service.py`

8. **app/services/usage_service.py** (25% coverage)

   - **Strategy**: Create comprehensive service tests
   - **Test file**: `tests/test_usage_service.py`

9. **app/services/template_service.py** (24% coverage)

   - **Strategy**: Create comprehensive service tests
   - **Test file**: `tests/test_template_service.py`

10. **app/services/security_monitoring.py** (38% coverage)

    - **Strategy**: Create comprehensive service tests
    - **Test file**: `tests/test_security_monitoring.py`

11. **app/services/security_service.py** (42% coverage)

    - **Strategy**: Add missing service tests to existing test file
    - **Test file**: `tests/test_security_service.py`

12. **app/services/session_service.py** (30% coverage)

    - **Strategy**: Create comprehensive service tests
    - **Test file**: `tests/test_session_service.py`

13. **app/services/storage_service.py** (27% coverage)

    - **Strategy**: Create comprehensive service tests
    - **Test file**: `tests/test_storage_service.py`

14. **app/services/two_factor.py** (42% coverage)

    - **Strategy**: Add missing service tests to existing test file
    - **Test file**: `tests/test_two_factor.py`

15. **app/api/v1/endpoints/workshop.py** (27% coverage)
    - **Strategy**: Create comprehensive endpoint tests
    - **Test file**: `tests/api/v1/test_workshop.py`

### Phase 2: Medium Priority (50-80% coverage) - 25 files

Files with moderate coverage that need targeted improvements.

### Phase 3: High Priority (80-99% coverage) - 49 files

Files close to 100% that need minor improvements.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Test File Organization

1. **Prefer existing test files** when they partially cover the target
2. **Create new test files** only when:
   - No existing test file covers the target
   - The target is complex enough to justify dedicated tests
   - The target has no logical overlap with existing test files

### Test Writing Standards

1. **Follow existing conventions** (pytest fixtures, naming, layout)
2. **Use meaningful test names** that describe the scenario
3. **Test both success and failure cases**
4. **Mock external dependencies** appropriately
5. **Ensure tests are maintainable** and not overly complex

### Coverage Targets

- **100% coverage** on all source files (where feasible)
- **Focus on critical business logic** and error handling
- **Test edge cases** and boundary conditions
- **Ensure error paths** are covered

## Execution Plan

### Step 1: Analyze Missing Coverage

For each file, identify:

- Which lines are not covered
- What scenarios those lines represent
- How to trigger those scenarios in tests

### Step 2: Prioritize by Impact

- **Security-related files** (auth, security, payment) - Highest priority
- **Core business logic** (assignment, user, submission) - High priority
- **Utility services** (cache, logging, monitoring) - Medium priority
- **Admin/auxiliary features** - Lower priority

### Step 3: Implement Tests

1. Start with Phase 1 critical files
2. Add tests to existing files when possible
3. Create new test files only when necessary
4. Validate coverage after each file

### Step 4: Validation

- Run full test suite after each improvement
- Ensure no regressions
- Verify coverage improvements
- Document changes

## Success Metrics

- **Overall coverage â‰¥80%**
- **100% coverage on critical files**
- **No new test files created unnecessarily**
- **All tests passing**
- **Clear documentation of improvements**

## Notes

- Some files may have legitimate reasons for <100% coverage (e.g., error handling for unreachable conditions)
- Focus on meaningful coverage rather than just hitting 100%
- Maintain test quality and maintainability
