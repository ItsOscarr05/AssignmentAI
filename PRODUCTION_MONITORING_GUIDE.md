# AssignmentAI Production Monitoring & Emergency Response

## Overview

This document covers the production monitoring and emergency response systems for AssignmentAI. These tools help ensure your production environment remains healthy and provide quick response capabilities during incidents.

## üìä Production Monitoring

### Monitoring Script: `scripts/monitor-production.ps1`

The production monitoring script provides comprehensive health checks and automated alerting for your AssignmentAI deployment.

#### Features

- **Health Endpoint Monitoring**: Checks frontend, API, and monitoring dashboards
- **Docker Service Status**: Verifies all containers are running
- **System Resource Monitoring**: CPU, memory, and disk usage
- **Database Backup Verification**: Ensures backups are recent
- **SSL Certificate Monitoring**: Checks certificate expiration
- **Email Alerts**: Sends notifications for critical issues

#### Usage

```powershell
# Basic monitoring
.\scripts\monitor-production.ps1

# Silent mode (no console output, only alerts)
.\scripts\monitor-production.ps1 -Silent

# With email alerts
.\scripts\monitor-production.ps1 -EmailAlerts

# Custom config file
.\scripts\monitor-production.ps1 -ConfigFile ".env.production"
```

#### Configuration

Add these environment variables to your `.env.production`:

```bash
# Alert email configuration
ALERT_EMAIL=admin@assignmentai.app
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=noreply@assignmentai.app
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-smtp-password
```

#### Monitoring Thresholds

The script uses these default thresholds (configurable in the script):

- **CPU Usage**: 80%
- **Memory Usage**: 85%
- **Disk Usage**: 90%
- **Response Time**: 5 seconds

#### Automated Monitoring Setup

**Windows Task Scheduler:**

```powershell
# Create scheduled task to run every 5 minutes
schtasks /create /tn "AssignmentAI-Monitoring" /tr "powershell -File 'C:\path\to\scripts\monitor-production.ps1 -Silent -EmailAlerts'" /sc minute /mo 5 /ru "SYSTEM"

# Create scheduled task to run every hour
schtasks /create /tn "AssignmentAI-Monitoring-Hourly" /tr "powershell -File 'C:\path\to\scripts\monitor-production.ps1 -EmailAlerts'" /sc hourly /ru "SYSTEM"
```

**Linux Cron (if using WSL):**

```bash
# Add to crontab -e
*/5 * * * * /usr/bin/powershell -File /path/to/scripts/monitor-production.ps1 -Silent -EmailAlerts
0 * * * * /usr/bin/powershell -File /path/to/scripts/monitor-production.ps1 -EmailAlerts
```

## üö® Emergency Response

### Emergency Response Script: `scripts/emergency-response.ps1`

The emergency response script provides quick actions for critical production issues.

#### Available Actions

| Action        | Description                      | Use Case                                 |
| ------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `maintenance` | Enable/disable maintenance mode  | Planned maintenance, security incidents  |
| `backup`      | Create emergency database backup | Before risky operations, data protection |
| `restart`     | Restart all services             | Service issues, memory leaks             |
| `rollback`    | Rollback to previous deployment  | Failed deployments, critical bugs        |
| `security`    | Handle security incidents        | Security breaches, unauthorized access   |
| `help`        | Show help information            | Get usage information                    |

#### Usage

```powershell
# Show help
.\scripts\emergency-response.ps1 -Action help

# Enable maintenance mode
.\scripts\emergency-response.ps1 -Action maintenance

# Create emergency backup

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Monitoring Script Fails

**Symptoms:** Script exits with error
**Solutions:**

- Check environment variables are set
- Verify Docker services are running
- Check network connectivity

#### 2. Health Checks Fail

**Symptoms:** Health endpoints return errors
**Solutions:**

- Check service logs: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs`
- Verify database connectivity
- Check Redis connectivity

#### 3. Emergency Script Fails

**Symptoms:** Emergency actions don't work
**Solutions:**

- Check Docker is running
- Verify Git repository is clean
- Check file permissions

### Debug Commands

```powershell
# Check Docker services
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml ps

# Check service logs
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs backend
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs frontend

# Check system resources
Get-Counter "\Processor(_Total)\% Processor Time"
Get-Counter "\Memory\% Committed Bytes In Use"

# Test health endpoints manually
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://assignmentai.app/health"
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://api.assignmentai.app/health"
```
